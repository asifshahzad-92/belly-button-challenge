## Javascript Visualizations

**Overview**
In this bootcamp challenge we were required to make an interactive dashboard for *Belly Button Biodiversity* which allows users to visualize and analyze microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) present in individuals' belly buttons. The data shows that 70% of the people have a small handful of species; however, the rest were relatively rare.

 **Findings**

1. Demographic information of *ID 940*
